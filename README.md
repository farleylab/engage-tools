# EnGAGE: Entire Genome seArches for Grammars of Enhancers 

## What is it? 

**EnGAGE** is a software toolkit developed by The Farley Lab at the University of California, San Diego to help study genome regulation, specifically through understanding "enhancer grammar." **Enhancer grammar** is the synergy between transcription factor binding site number, order, spacing, orientation, and affinity to confer tissue-specific expression patterns. 

We were inspired to create **EnGAGE** following our lab's work in studying a notochord enhancer grammar within the *Ciona intestinalis* genome consisting of a particular combination of Zic, ETS, FoxA, and Brachyury transcription factor binding sites. 

This toolkit is meant to explore genomic data and find putative enhancers of interest in a way that is easy and intuitive for the scientific community. Additionally, we hope to provide resources for visualizing this information!
