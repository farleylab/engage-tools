# EnGAGE

## What is it? 

**EnGAGE** *(**E**ntire **G**enome se**A**rches for **G**rammars of **E**nhancers)* is a software toolkit developed by [The Farley Lab](https://farleylab.com) at the [University of California, San Diego School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx) to help study genome regulation, specifically through understanding "enhancer grammar." **Enhancer grammar** is the synergy between transcription factor binding site number, order, spacing, orientation, and affinity to confer tissue-specific expression patterns. 

We were inspired to create **EnGAGE** following our lab's work in studying a notochord enhancer grammar within the *Ciona intestinalis* genome consisting of a particular combination of Zic, ETS, FoxA, and Brachyury transcription factor binding sites. 

This toolkit is meant to explore genomic data and find putative enhancers of interest in a way that is easy and intuitive for the scientific community. Additionally, we hope to provide resources for visualizing this information!

* [*TBA*] `engage.filter` : Filters on clusters of transcription factor binding motifs of interest to meet structural constraints 
* [*TBA*] `engage.plot` : Visualizes clusters of transcription factor binding motifs of interests across a given genome and/or specified region
